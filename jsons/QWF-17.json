    "caption": "The beginning of the video shows the recruit, frantically waving for the wounded veteran, hoping to get the attention of a passing car loaded with soldiers. But none of the cars stopped for them, and at last the new soldier had to carry the old soldier forward. The new soldier spent a lot of effort to carry the wounded veteran to a medical place for the wounded soldiers, and then very tired he picked up the canteen on the table and began to drink water and rest. He kept comforting the wounded veteran, whose vital signs were gradually disappearing. The recruits then followed the army to an empty square, listened to a speech by an officer, and then moved on to other battlefields without any attention.",
